## Abstract

Balancing ecological sustainability with socio-economic development presents a significant challenge for mega-urban regions. Here we introduce a spatial analysis framework that combines clustering techniques with production possibility frontier methodology to quantify and visualize the trade-offs between {{< sdghl goal="15" >}}ecosystem service value{{< /sdghl >}} and  {{< sdghl goal="10" >}} socio-economic well-being{{< /sdghl >}}. Applying this to the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, we identified five distinct eco-socio-economic zones, each requiring different management approaches. Our analysis revealed that economically developed coastal areas exhibit high production efficiency but limited ecological capacity, while less-developed peripheral areas demonstrate significant untapped potential for ecosystem services enhancement. Based on these insights, we formulated tailored strategies for {{< sdghl goal="11" >}}sustainable urban management{{< /sdghl >}}, including targeted ecological compensation mechanisms between beneficiary and provider regions. This integrated approach provides environmental planners and urban policymakers with a practical toolkit for optimizing sustainability outcomes in complex urban agglomerations, balancing regional economic aspirations with ecological imperatives.
