I am pleased to announce that our latest paper, **"LLM4GKID: Identifying Ghost Kitchens through Large Language Models and Multi-source Data Integration,"** has been accepted for publication in **IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems (TCSS)**.

This work marks a significant milestone for the RGC-funded project, *"Bridging Bites and Bytes: Measuring, Modelling, and Planning for the Emerging Online-offline Nexus in Urban Food Environments"* (PI: Prof. Yang). The proposed LLM4GKID framework leverages the semantic power of Large Language Models to align disparate data sources, providing a scalable solution for detecting "ghost kitchens" within complex urban foodscapes.

This achievement is the result of a dedicated collaborative effort. I would like to extend my sincere thanks to my teammates, **Yihong** and **Chaofan**, for their hard work, and to **Prof. Yang** for his invaluable supervision and guidance throughout the process.

I also wish to express my gratitude to the anonymous reviewers and the editor, [Prof. Bin Hu](https://pure.bit.edu.cn/en/persons/bin-hu-2/), for their constructive feedback and efforts in improving the quality of this manuscript.
