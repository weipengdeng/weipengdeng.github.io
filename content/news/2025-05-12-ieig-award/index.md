I am honored to be part of a research team awarded the **Gold Medal** at the [**50th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva (IEIG)**](https://www.inventions-geneva.ch/en/about/), one of the world’s most prestigious platforms for innovation and applied research. Founded in 1972 by Jean-Luc Vincent, the International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva is held annually under the patronage of the **Swiss Government**, the **Republic and Canton of Geneva**, the **City of Geneva**, and the **World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)**, and is widely recognized as the premier global exhibition for inventions and technological innovation.

IEIG brings together researchers, inventors, and industry leaders from around the world, providing a unique international platform that bridges scientific research, technological innovation, and real-world applications.

### Invention Highlight: Neighborhood DNA Decoder
The Gold Medal was awarded for our invention, **“Neighborhood DNA Decoder: Predictive AI Platform for Data Integration & Decision Optimization.”** The platform integrates multi-source urban and business data using patented artificial intelligence technology to uncover hidden patterns, decode neighborhood characteristics, and support data-driven strategic decision-making.

Specifically, our system:
* Integrates heterogeneous urban, socioeconomic, and business datasets at multiple spatial scales.
* Identifies latent neighborhood patterns and community profiles through AI-driven representation learning.
* Achieves substantial higher predictive accuracy and  significant faster analytical performance compared to conventional analytical workflows.

### Collaborative Achievement
This invention is the result of close collaboration among **Prof.Tianren Yang, Prof.Weifeng Li, Prof.Degao Zheng, Mr. Yongbo Zhang, and Mr. Weipeng Deng (student awardee)**, jointly developed by **The University of Hong Kong** and the **China Academy of Urban Planning and Design (CAUPD)**. The work emerged from a CAUPD-led collaborative research project, combining academic research with applied urban innovation.

I would like to sincerely acknowledge the supervision, guidance, and support provided by senior collaborators and institutional partners throughout the development of this work. I am also deeply grateful to the IEIG organizing committee and award committee for this recognition, and for maintaining such a high-standard international platform for showcasing impactful innovations.
