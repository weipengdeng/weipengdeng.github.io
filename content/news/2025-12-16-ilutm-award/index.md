I am honored to have received the **Best Student Presentation Award (Silver Prize)** at the **9th International Conference on Integrated Land-use Transport Modeling (ILUTM-9)** held in Wuhan, China. 

The conference, hosted by the Wuhan University of Technology and co-hosted by the Beijing Institute of Technology, served as a premier international platform for discussing AI-powered integrated modeling and decision-making support for future urban planning.

### Research Highlight: Digital Visibility, Physical Obscurity
Our award-winning presentation, titled **Digital Visibility, Physical Obscurity: Uncovering the Location Strategies of Ghost Kitchens in Platform Urbanism?** explores the tension between digital platform presence and physical urban footprints. 

By utilizing multimodal data fusion and spatial modeling, our study:
* Investigates how ghost kitchens challenge existing urban governance and regulatory frameworks.
* Demonstrates how AI can reduce information asymmetries in the digital era.
* Introduces [**LLM4GKID**](https://weipengdeng.github.io/LLM4GKID), our open-source tool that leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to identify ghost kitchens at scale.

### Collaborative Success
This project is the result of a wonderful collaboration with **Yihong Tang** (McGill University) and **Chaofan Wang**, under the expert supervision of **Prof. Tianren Yang**. Notably, the methodology presented has recently been accepted for publication in *IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems*.

I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the ILUTM-9 organizing committee and the award committee for this recognition, and to my team for their invaluable contributions.
