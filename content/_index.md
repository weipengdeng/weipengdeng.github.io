I am a PhD student studying how digital transformation reshapes everyday travel behavior and the built environment. My research acknowledges the complexity of urban functioning as an interconnected system, with particular attention to the interactions between adaptive commercial systems, equitable foodscapes, and sustainable built environments. I am especially interested in developing scalable, cost-effective, and reproducible analytical tools to support urban research and practice.
